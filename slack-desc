pygtk: PyGTK - GTK+ bindings for Python
pygtk:
pygtk: PyGTK provides a convenient wrapper for the GTK+ library for use in
pygtk: Python programs, and takes care of many of the boring details such as
pygtk: managing memory and type casting. When combined with PyORBit and
pygtk: gnome-python, it can be used to write full featured GNOME apps.
